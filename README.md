## Back 2 Basics

I have, predictably and finally, come to the conclusion that I need to go back to basics. What does that mean? It means that my knowledge of the Godot Engine and 3D game programming is to limited to work on importing advanced models into the game. That takes to much time and effort, time and effort that should and must be spent on learning "the ropes". The ropes in this case is concepts such as local transforms, rotating objects and not the camera, and so forth. The TODO-list will still be basically the same, we will just start "anew".

### Things that need to be done

The thing in cursive is what I am working on right now.

- [ ] Level 2
- [ ] Visual Stylings
- [x] Enemy Entity 1
- [x] Shooting
- [x] Level 1
- [x] *Player 0*
- [x] Player Entity 1

## Enemy Entity 1 <- Doing now
### Mechanics
Here we go with the AI again, don't we? The enemy has to be able to walk around, look for stuff, react to things - and make decisions.
So, some more notes on this... there are Behavior Tree implementations out there and they're a bit annoying, to say the very least.


## Shooting
### Mechanics
So, for now the weapon is quite tightly coupled to the player, but it is there. There is a poor effect when hitting something, but it is there. The enemy that I so happened to create is also there and can not only take damage, but also die. There is a signal for death and taking damage, meaning that the enemy could in fact blink or something when taking a hit. Very cool.


## Level 1
### Mechanics
After many trials and tribulations, I stand here again, ready to make a level of some sorts. I will try to accomplish this in the simplest way possible. It will most likely be combined with shooting and enemies, because that is how I roll.

## Player 0
### Mechanics
The player should be able to walk around - and how do I want to do that? Do I want it to be nsew-oriented, or more like propulsion, rotation, direction, what? I think cognitively it is easier to do it nsew-oriented, it is the way both south park and helldivers work with their controls. 

So, what we have now is an ugly model doing ugly model things - but that is friggin' great. So great! 

## Enemy Entity 1 <- doing now
### Mechanics
Update: I will not use Mixamo for the enemy character, as of now.

What is the mechanics for this first implementation of enemies in the game? Well, they should be simple, not complicated at all. I would like the enemy to be able to idle, walk, and do some kind of simple attack. I decided to use Mixamo again, but I would like to find some kind of "simpler" character somewhere on the Interwebs to make the next task, having a cool visual style of the game, work. I notice that my work here, compared to the work I did on the other game, is less straight-forward. This is most likely due to me not being comfortable with what I am doing, not really having a *feel* for how the engine actually works. This is fine. So, anyways, I want to have behavior trees as well, so we should look into the absolutely simplest way to get that done in the game.

The enemy should basically only want to do the simplest possible things right now: walk around, searching for player to attack. So, the next step is to import the downloaded asset into Godot and make stuff happen from there. 

- [ ] Create Model
- [ ] Create ontrols
- [ ] Put in map
- [ ] Attach a behavior tree to it


## Player Entity 1 - done
It would be cool to import a very cool character in the game, but it is absolutely not important. We have a character imported, the roth character. Todo:
- [x] move the player character in / on the level
- [x] show different anims
- [ ] Rotate character in direction of movement - seems very hard. 

## Level 1 - doing now
The reason we need to start work on the level is because without it, there is nothing for the player to move about on. 

* create a simple plane - done
* import some Kenney assets - done

I'm just dictating this because I can't be bothered to write it on a home screen keyboard and more anyways I might not have the time to do free form exploring every time I sit down to work on the game therefore it is very important to decide something to work on for a specific work chunk of time so if I decide for instance to sit down for 45 minutes I should have something decided beforehand to actually work a problem to solve a thing to achieve so like I have been able to import taxes Frances which is really cool mixamo characters oh yeah this was interesting import characters not pay taxes in Francis I've no idea what to do is doing and with so I be imported characters what what is it that I want to do next and it should be related to the game I shouldn't be fiddling about with different animations of stuff I should just work on something so I could try applying applying the cool shade at to the can't drive over to go and I should also try to report the FBI X cuharacter of from Kenny's stuff because they're more cartoons fits better than I should wasn't try to pixelated fader

Can I dictate a text and say for instance, oh that's nice so instead of, can I say something like. To end sentences where you normally say.


To make sure I never finish everything, I am now trynig out using the Godot Engine to make a game.

## Devlog

### Friday 6th of August 2021

#### 23:00 hrs

I have started to understand some things. So I can import mixamo characters, but I actually do not want those characters, I want something else. I want a really cool-looking character - in the future.

So, doing

OK, så man kan inte skriva på engelska med iPad:en så det blir fucking engelska nu.

Jag tänker pröva att köra 3d for the heck of it. Men då måste vi göra en superdupertajt POC för att se om det är något att ha, samt en plan för genomförande. Vi går baklänges och börjar med superenkel grafik - för det går alltid att lösa senare.

POC-todo:
* Spelar-entitet
* Fiende-entitet
* Målobjekt
* Fiendefödsloplatser
* Skjuta
* Skada

Om jag kan göra de där sakerna under helgen så tror jag vi kan testa att gå 3D generellt, för det är ju superkul, väl?

So a small To Do List for the 3D variant of the game is to be able to create. 

A player entity. 
Enemy entity. 
Objective. 
Enemy spawn points. 
Shooting mechanics. 
Damage to both player and enemy.
GamePad control support.


## Should we go 3D?

Creating sprites is a goddamned hassle. Buying them as well. But I can't really say that I have what it takes to do a 3d game either? Aaargh.

Check the tutorial for 3d, perhaps?


## The Backlog to End All Backlogs

Fun story, I have already made this game, once, in libGDX. But the tooling is non-existant so that felt like it was sort of grinding to a halt, a little bit, at least. I just want to make some games.

Anywas, I have a bunch of stuff that I already have, or am planning to have, in the "old" game. The old game that was supposed to be a clone of Turbo Raketti Ultra but immediately turned into my old classic "way too ambitious game for a first-timer".

Anyways, this list is obviously wrong. I need to pare it down, considerably.

We have player movement and sprites. So, what is absolutely necessary as the NEXT thing to do?

I want to make a nice map. I would really like that. Do I actually HAVE to make my own tiles? Perhaps I could just apply some filters to some tileset? Buy an isometric tileset from somewhere?

Or is it time to go "voxel" now? As an experiment? Look into it?

So, there was a lot going on in the old game.

## Based on IsoMetric example from Godot Asset Store

# Original Readme:

# Isometric Game

This demo shows a traditional isometric view with depth sorting.

A character can move around the level and will also slide around objects,
as well as be occluded when standing in front or behind them.

Language: GDScript

Renderer: GLES 2

Check out this demo on the asset library: https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/112
## How does it work?

The level uses a [`TileMap`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_tilemap.html#class-tilemap)
in which the tiles have different vertical offsets.
The walls, doors, and pillars each have
[`StaticBody2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_staticbody2d.html)
and [`CollisionPolygon2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_collisionpolygon2d.html)
at their base. The player also has a collider at its base,
which makes the player collide with the level.
